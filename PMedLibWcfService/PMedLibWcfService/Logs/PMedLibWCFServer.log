Continuous objective value is 957 - 0.00 seconds
processed model has 0 rows, 0 columns (0 integer) and 0 elements
No integer variables - nothing to do
Cuts at root node changed objective from 957 to -1.79769e+308
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
